# HandwritingComparison
Handwriting Comparison using Machine Learning

Using machine learning to find the similarity between handwritten samples of known and unknown writers by using gradient descent for linear regression
and logistic regression, and also using neural networks. The datasets used are Humans Observed Dataset containing 791 same-writer pairs and 293,032 different-writer pairs with 9 features for each
sample and GSC Dataset containing 71531 same-writer pairs and 762,557 different-writer pairs with 512 features for each sample.
